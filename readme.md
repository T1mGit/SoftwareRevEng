<h1>Reverse Engineering Challenges</h1>
These are software reverse engineering challenges which can be found [here](https://challenges.re).
I was disappointed to discover that my uni course diddnt include a reverse engineering or assembly unit, however this site seem to have quite a wide selection for challenges.
I also find <www.tutorialspoint.com> to be an incredible resource for tutorials in just about anything computer related.
This [online lecture](http://www.c-jump.com/CIS77/ASM/Assembly/lecture.html) is quite a concise explanation of ASM assembly probramming too.
